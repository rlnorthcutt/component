# component
Refactor of the Drupal PDB module to backport some enhancements in other 
modules, update the codebase, and change the namespace.

## TODO
- Write up general docs
- Put on D.o
- Write up docs on config file and options
- Check that components only are available if module is on 
-- "module: active" in yml
- create some more examples - form config, backbone

- See if I can get this work with ACSF (might need a submodule)
