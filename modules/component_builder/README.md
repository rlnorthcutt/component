Placeholder for future *component_builder* module. To allow users to create simple JS components in the UI without having to commit code. Extends custom blocks with fields for css, js, and html. Registers as a component, and is available when published.

Vision is to have a real time working tool similar to codepen, so you can create/test your component as you go.

Fields
- Title - text field
- machine name (optionally generated from title)
- css - textarea (with formatting like asset injector)
- js - textarea (with formatting like asset injector)
- html - textarea (with fomratting like asset injector)
- published - checkbox
- core libraries to include - checkboxes  (jquery, settings, backbone, etc.)

Future option - download/export component
